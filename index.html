            <p>These red, dog-like creatures are fairly known because of their implication in japanese folklore and the mistery of what sound they emit (whose answer is they actually laugh, thing that pissed off farmers in the past)</p>

            <p>These amazonic birds stand out because of the form of their beaks, which colors varies according to the toucan species we're talkin about (so in other words their beaks have alt skins)</p>

            <p>Pretty chill, giant and smart creatures. Fun fact: elephants think we humans are cute just in the same way we think puppies are cute</p>

        <p1> This is actually my first "serious" project. I'd want to keep it as a memory to look back where i began in the future. Could I've chosen a more serious subject? Yeah probably, but it wouldn't had been fun that way, right? Plus, animals are cool</p1>
